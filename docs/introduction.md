# Introduction

Welcome to Qscaler!

QScaler is an open-source, Kubernetes-native worker controller that scales pods based on queue rate and length. It provides an intelligent solution for managing queue-based workers, addressing the limitations of existing systems like KEDA, and ensures efficient processing without disrupting in-progress tasks.
